# JAPA (Just A Personal Assistant)

I felt annoyed having to open a another program or website if I have to do something simple. Its easier and more convenient for me. I prefer making it myself so I can really customize it and learn along the way.

# Usage

Its still simple (for now).

## Converting Units

To convert units, simply write in the format "<magnitude> <unit> to <unit>"

### Examples

```
> 17 kmph to mph
17,000.00 mph

> 21 meter/second to inch/minute
49,606.30 inch / minute

> 14 degC to degK
287.15 kelvin
```

## Solving Math Expressions

### Examples

```
> 17 * 21
357.00
> 64 / x = 16
4.00
```

## Opening Files

You can open files by typing "f" followed by the bookmark key stored in the "bookmark.json". I use abbreviation because its purpose is to speed up access.

### Examples

```
> f c
> f proj
> f tm
```

# Dependencies
